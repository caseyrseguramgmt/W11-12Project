## Progress
    05/01
    1. Solution for the captcha was found with using an input() for the user to solve the captcha manually. The problem with this is that if I planned to run the script more then once it would have to be manually done many times. Currently looking for a work around, will proceed. (May switch site?) Also captcha after being solved once does not populate everytime.
    2. Blocker of trying to webscrap data off website due to the site having more then one data chart with graph with same class.
    3. Looking at information online with to find the specific graph I want.
    4. Still stuck on isolating the chart.
    5. Looking at udemy course documentation to continue on how to get data printed to the terminal in order to make a db.
